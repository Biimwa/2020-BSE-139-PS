VideoSlim Library
The VideoSlim library is a powerful yet lightweight tool for recording, compressing, decompressing, and saving videos. It is designed to simplify the process of compressing video files while offering flexibility and ease of integration into your projects.

Features
1. Record and Compress Video
Easily capture video from either a camera or a file and apply compression with a specified ratio. This feature is beneficial for scenarios where storage space is a concern, and a balance between video quality and size is essential.

2. Decompress and Save Video
Effortlessly decompress videos that were previously compressed using VideoSlim. Save decompressed videos in various formats, providing the flexibility needed for different applications.

3. Simple Integration
The library offers a straightforward interface for seamless integration into your Python projects. The provided example code demonstrates the basic usage of the VideoSlim library.
